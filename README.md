# Malicious-URL

 **# Malicious URL Detector**


This application detects malicious URLs, classifying them into benign, defacement, phishing, or malware categories. It leverages a machine learning model to analyze URLs and produce predictions.

**## Installation**

   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**## Usage**
  

 **Enter or provide a list of URLs to analyze.**

 **The application will process the URLs and output their predicted categories (benign, defacement, phishing, or malware).**

**## Model Details**
